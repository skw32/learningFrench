This repo contains a collection of mini games written in Python3 aimed at helping to learn French vocabularly.

This project also makes heavy use of the tutorial material from realpython.com for using the arcade Python library, which can be found here: https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework

This project is still in a development process. Games 1 and 3 have working prototypes but the vocabulary data is not currently released with the code in this repo.
