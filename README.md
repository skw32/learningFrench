This repo contains a collection of mini games written in Python3 aimed at helping to learn French vocabularly.

This project was made possible by the existence of a rich and very uniformly formatted document published online with some of the most common French vocabularly, which can be found here: http://ekladata.com/6FxXu86fl5mQwo7lEyDS5hG9NTc.pdf

This project almost makes heavy use of the tutorial material from realpython.com for using the arcade Python library, which can be found here: https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework

This project is still in a development process, but feel free to give them a go - bon courage!
